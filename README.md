# SentimentAnalysis


This project is an extension of the work that I was doing for my Database Design and Algorithms classes at Northeastern University

The general idea is to create a Natural Language processing algorithm that classifies ideas from [stocktwits](http://www.stocktwits.com)
into moods.

Those moods are then correlated to the progression of the S&P 500 index to track any predictive power of the sentiments that were derived.
